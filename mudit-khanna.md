# Items done by Mudit Khanna

- Created the xml from the json provided by specifying appropriate tag names and adding sub elements.
- Wrote the html and the Javascript script to dynamically populate data from the xml into the html file.
- For the same same created separate parser functions which can parse the element and return appropriate objects which can be further used by functions to either parse or simply access object properities to display the content on the DOM.
- Me and Ishita both joined hands to do the XSL since we had to display the content in the form of a table and we had nested element structure
